# Assignment: One HTML and CSS | Zach Bohenick



----
## Approach
I wanted to start by considering the audience. As a student in the course, I highlighted the most important sections:

1. Schedule
2. Groups
3. Contact
4. Assignments

Since the course schedule is most important, I thought it was more useful to put the schedule on the home page.<sup>**7**</sup>

I wanted the experience to feel like the user was not straying far from the schedule, so I changed the navigation on every page to travel back to the home page. I did this by replacing the traditional navigation with a **done** button.

Regarding the schedule navigation, I thought it was intuitive to have a **current week** button to scroll the user to the current week. I wrote a javascript function *in main.js* to perform this task.<sup>**6**</sup>

## Design

My first consideration and main priority was to re-design the site with a mobile-first mindset becaue the original site was not responsive. I made the site responsive by:

1. Updating the site layout using CSS Grids.
2. Adding media queries to account for desktop displays.
3. Creating large navigation buttons.

I started by sketching several concepts with my priorities in mind. Content originally featured on the home page needed to be placed somewhere new, so I made an *about.html* page to hold the information about the course.

I re-colored the header background<sup>**1**</sup>, and changed the navigation. I added corresponding icons<sup>**3**</sup>, labels, and a background color with a border radius.

I also added an image to the *contact.html* page of Dr. Monberg. I think a picture of the professor allows the viewer to feel more engaged with the person they are trying to contact.<sup>**3**</sup>

For the schedule section, I added a title and the **current week** button. Then, I changed the layout into a single column, and increased the font weight of the week titles.<sup>**7**</sup>

I decided to use the font Open Sans for its clean appearance. The font is legible and the different font weights were helpful creating hierarchy.<sup>**2**</sup>

I changed the anchor tag link red to a brighter green. I thought this helped make the schedule look cleaner/prettier.<sup>**7**</sup>

## Additions

#### Table
The grading scale table is very basic, but I did format it to scale with the site window. Also, I added some color to make the table more interesting.<sup>**4**</sup>

#### Student Groups
For the groups, I formatted a grid to list each team member's name down a single column. I also increased the font size and weight of the section titles, and added a section underline. The width of the groups list is less than the section title, which I think is effective for the appearance and feel.<sup>**5**</sup>

With mobile-first thinking, I decided to avoid using more than one column.<sup>**5**</sup>


## Required Changes to WRA 410
1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.
   
2. Use a new font.
    
3. Include two images.
   
4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  

6. Add navgation to the Schedule webpage.

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.
