# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410
First, I edited the site to use css grids, and added media queries. I also added a hover function for the anchor tags.

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.
    * I reformatted the course website header title, and changed the background of the schedule page to match. Also, I decided to change the footer color to match the header so that the site feels more together. It's a personal choice because I like my header and footer to act like two pieces of the same loaf of bread (if that makes any sense).
2. Use a new font.
    * I changed the font to Rubik. I think Rubik is a fun and versatile font. The heavier font weights really stand out for headers and hierarchy.
3. Include two images.
    * The first image I added was a picture of Dr. John Monberg in the contact page. I think a picture of the professor allows the viewer to feel more engaged with the person they are trying to contact.
    * The second image is the logo of the Atom text editing software. I think it is important for a student who is new to the software to understand what it looks like visually. This will help when they search for "Atom" on Google.
4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.
    * Although I did create a table, I did not include any table lines. I did this for reasons of continuity, as I wanted to keep everything looking similar. The table provides structure, but does not stand out.
5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  
    * I made sure the groups navigation button was on every page, and added the "selected" class to the menu item.
    * I made the team names and formatting match the rest of the site, with bold titles and a hover animation.
6. Add navgation to the Schedule webpage.
    * I used the same navigation styling and id as the rest of the site. I believe continuity is important. I also styled the nav differently, adding a hover color and increasing the line height to 2. Also, I added the selected class to "schedule". This makes navigating through the site feel smooth and comfortable.
7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.
    * I created a new grid for the schedule which included the dded media queries to the grid.
    * To make the grid clearer and prettier, I added media queries so that it is easily accessible on mobile.
    * I also added a bit of padding on the top to separate the grid from the header.

## Grading Criteria
